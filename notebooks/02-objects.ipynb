    "Python as programming language has been very successful in recent years and one reason is the simplicity with which code can be turned into general-use libraries and shared via `pip` (it is not trivial, but far easier than in other langauges!). Such shared code is provided by <i>modules</i> that can be loaded using the `import` statement. Python comes with a series of code modules, the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/\">Python standard library</a>. A few notable examples are the following:\n",
